#+title waftools

This area holds some tooling for use of waf and other things.  

It is meant to be included in some other source repository via a git
submodule as a [[tools/]] sub directory.

* Waf tools

The main content are "waf tools" used for finding and building against
software dependencies.  In a top-level ~wscript~ file add:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
sys.path.append('tools')
#+END_SRC

Then call the provided tools in the usual Waf way.

* Scripts

A number of helper scripts are here.

** Mucking with Git

You can switch the Git URLs between dev (SSH) and anon (HTTPS)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./tools/repo-helper switch-url dev
  $ ./tools/repo-helper switch-url anon
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Mucking with UPS

You can build a UPS product

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ # set up ups and dependencies
  $ ./tools/create-ups-product.sh /wcdo/lib/ups v00_01_00 e15 czmq protobuf
#+END_EXAMPLE
